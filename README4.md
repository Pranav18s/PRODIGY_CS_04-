# PRODIGY_CS_04 - Simple Keylogger Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple keylogger using Python and the `pynput` library. The keylogger captures keystrokes and logs them for educational and ethical purposes only.

## Features
- Logs alphanumeric keystrokes.
- Captures special keys (e.g., Enter, Space) and logs them with clear identification.
- Saves the keystrokes to a text file.

## Ethical Considerations
This keylogger is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how keystrokes can be captured. **It is crucial to use this tool ethically and with the permission of the users involved.** Always ensure transparency when working with such tools in real-world applications.

_"With great power comes great responsibility." - Voltaire_
